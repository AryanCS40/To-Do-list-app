📝 My To-Do App

A simple and responsive To-Do List Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, with data saved in localStorage so tasks persist even after reloading the page.

🚀 Features

➕ Add new tasks

✅ Mark tasks as completed (toggle)

❌ Delete tasks

💾 Persistent storage using localStorage

🎨 Clean UI with modern styling

⚙️ How It Works

Type a task in the input box and press the + button.

Tasks are displayed in a list with two action buttons:

✅ Complete → Marks the task as done (strikethrough effect).

❌ Delete → Removes the task.

Tasks are saved in the browser’s localStorage.
